# 🚀 DSA CLI Automation Tool

A personal command-line interface tool designed to streamline the workflow of solving Data Structures and Algorithms problems. It automates file creation, boilerplate generation, metadata tracking, and Git synchronization.

## ✨ Features

* **⚡ Automated Workflow:** Collects metadata, creates the file with a C++ template, opens VS Code, and handles `git push` automatically.
* **📂 Repo Agnostic:** Works from any terminal location; always saves to your configured DSA repository.
* **📊 Progress Tracking:** View stats like current streak, total solved, and difficulty breakdown.
* **🔍 Smart Search:** Fuzzy search to quickly find and open old solutions (e.g., `two sum` finds `Two_Sum.cpp`).
* **🧠 Spaced Repetition:** Randomly picks old problems for you to review.
